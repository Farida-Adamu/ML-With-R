# KNN-Breast-Cancer-Test-Prediction

This is a beginner-friendly approach to machine learning with R, emphasizing reproducibility and interpretability. The provided code performs an analysis using the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm on a breast cancer dataset. 

The k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks, as well as pattern recognition. 

The code provides a workflow for:
	1.	Preprocessing data for kNN.
	2.	Training a kNN model on a breast cancer dataset.
	3.	Evaluating the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy, sensitivity, and precision metrics.
